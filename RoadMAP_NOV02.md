RESTAPI_ROADMAP for High Score Project

Overview

This roadmap outlines the vision, core functionalities, and future plans for the High Score project. The High Score project aims to build a RESTful API that records, updates, and retrieves player high scores for various games. It serves as a centralized high score management system and can be integrated with multiple gaming platforms.

Project Status

Current Phase: Testing and Verification
Scope: Enterprise System
Development Model: Full-Stack Development
Project Characteristics

Interoperability: The High Score artifact will be designed to interact seamlessly with other software components and data sets.
Independence: The system will function as a standalone application, while also being capable of integration with other platforms and data sets.
Scalability: Designed for both small and large-scale deployments.
Project Components and Roadmap

Completed Phases

Project Setup: Initialized a Spring Boot project and made the initial Git commit.
Data Modeling: Created the High Score entity with essential attributes like player name and score.
Repository Layer: Implemented the High Score Repository for CRUD operations.
Service Layer: Created the Service Layer to interact with the Repository Layer.
Controller Layer: Defined the RESTful API endpoints for High Score management.
Exception Handling: Implemented global exception handling for robust error management.
Logging: Integrated logging to monitor system behavior and aid in debugging.
Current Phase

Testing:
Unit Testing: Conducting unit tests for model, repository, and service layers using JUnit and Mockito.
Integration Testing: Ensuring seamless interaction between the controller, service, and repository layers.
Database Testing: Employing an in-memory database like H2 for testing database interactions.
Upcoming Phases

Security Enhancements:

Authentication and Authorization: Implementing a secure authentication and authorization mechanism to safeguard access to sensitive API endpoints.
Data Encryption: Exploring data encryption solutions to protect sensitive data both at rest and in transit.
Deployment Strategies:

Containerization with Docker: Containerizing the application using Docker to streamline deployment, scaling, and management in different environments.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Setting up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment, enhancing the project’s agility and reliability.
Performance Optimization:

Database Optimization: Optimizing database queries, indexing, and caching mechanisms to enhance performance and reduce latency.
API Rate Limiting and Throttling: Implementing rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to manage traffic and ensure the API's availability and responsiveness.
Scalability Considerations:

Microservices Architecture: Assessing the feasibility of transitioning to a microservices architecture to enhance scalability and maintainability.
Load Balancing and Auto-scaling: Exploring load balancing and auto-scaling solutions to manage traffic spikes and ensure a seamless user experience.
Monitoring and Logging Enhancements:

Centralized Logging: Implementing a centralized logging solution to facilitate real-time monitoring, error tracking, and analysis.
Application Performance Monitoring (APM): Employing APM tools to gain insights into system performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize operations.
Front-End Development (if needed):

Develop the front-end interface for user interaction, providing a user-friendly platform to view and interact with high scores.
Community Engagement:

Open Source Contributions: Exploring the possibility of contributing to the open-source community, sharing learnings, and collaborating on solutions to common challenges.
User Community Building: Engaging with the user community, soliciting feedback, and fostering a collaborative environment for continuous improvement.
Documentation and Knowledge Sharing:

Comprehensive Documentation: Maintaining up-to-date, comprehensive documentation to ensure a clear understanding of the system, facilitate onboarding, and support maintenance efforts.
Knowledge Sharing Sessions: Organizing knowledge sharing sessions to foster a culture of continuous learning and collaboration among the development team.
Legal and Compliance Considerations:

Data Privacy Compliance: Ensuring compliance with data privacy laws and regulations, such as GDPR, to mitigate legal risks and uphold user trust.
Software License Compliance: Managing software licenses and ensuring compliance to mitigate legal risks and maintain a reputable project standing.
